## üí° Why Use outlineX-hs?

In a multi-window environment, it's easy to lose track of which application is truly active. outlineX-hs solves this by providing a clear, visual indicator. Whether you're a developer juggling multiple terminals, a designer switching between creative apps, or simply someone who wants better control over their digital workspace, this tool helps you maintain focus and improve your overall **macOS window management**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To use outlineX-hs, you first need to have [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/) installed. Hammerspoon is a powerful automation tool for macOS that allows you to control your desktop environment with Lua scripting.

1. **Download Hammerspoon:** If you don't have it already, download and install Hammerspoon from their official website: [https://www.hammerspoon.org/](https://www.hammerspoon.org/)

2. **Clone the Repository:** Open your Terminal and navigate to your Hammerspoon Spoons directory. If it doesn't exist, create it.

   ```bash
   cd ~/.hammerspoon/Spoons
   git clone https://github.com/x0d7x/outlineX-hs
   ```

## üöÄ Usage & Configuration

After installation, you need to load and configure outlineX-hs in your Hammerspoon configuration file, typically `~/.hammerspoon/init.lua`.

1. **Edit `~/.hammerspoon/init.lua`:** Open this file in your favorite text editor.

2. **Add Configuration:** Copy and paste the following lines into your `init.lua` file. You can adjust the `borderColor`, `borderWidth`, and `cornerRadius` to match your preferences.

   ```lua
   -- Load the OutlineX Spoon
   local ox = hs.loadSpoon("OutlineX_hs")

   -- Configure the border appearance (optional, defaults are applied if not set)
   ox.borderWidth = 6
   ox.borderColor = "#FF8800"
   ox.borderAlpha = 1
   ox.cornerRadius = 14

   -- Start the OutlineX functionality
   ox:start()
   ```

   **Note:** If you prefer to configure `OutlineX_hs` directly within your `init.lua` without using the `spoon` global, you can use the `local ox = hs.loadSpoon("OutlineX_hs")` approach as shown above.

   - **`spoon.OutlineX.borderColor`**: Sets the color of the border. Use a hex color code.
   - **`spoon.OutlineX.borderWidth`**: Sets the thickness of the border in pixels.
   - **`spoon.OutlineX.cornerRadius`**: Sets the radius for rounded corners in pixels.

3. **Reload Hammerspoon:** After saving `init.lua`, reload your Hammerspoon configuration (usually by clicking the Hammerspoon icon in your menubar and selecting "Reload Config" or by pressing `Cmd + Opt + Ctrl + R`).

### üõë Stopping the Border

To temporarily disable the window border without removing the configuration, you can call:

```lua
ox:stop()
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Restarting the Border

If you've stopped the border and wish to restart it, simply call:

```lua
ox:start()
```
