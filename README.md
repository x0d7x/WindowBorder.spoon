## üí° Why Use WindowBorder.spoon?

In a multi-window environment, it's easy to lose track of which application is truly active. WindowBorder.spoon solves this by providing a clear, visual indicator. Whether you're a developer juggling multiple terminals, a designer switching between creative apps, or simply someone who wants better control over their digital workspace, this tool helps you maintain focus and improve your overall **macOS window management**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To use WindowBorder.spoon, you first need to have [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/) installed. Hammerspoon is a powerful automation tool for macOS that allows you to control your desktop environment with Lua scripting.

1.  **Download Hammerspoon:** If you don't have it already, download and install Hammerspoon from their official website: [https://www.hammerspoon.org/](https://www.hammerspoon.org/)

2.  **Clone the Repository:** Open your Terminal and navigate to your Hammerspoon Spoons directory. If it doesn't exist, create it.

    ```bash
    cd ~/.hammerspoon/Spoons
    git clone https://github.com/x0d7x/WindowBorder.spoon
    ```

## üöÄ Usage & Configuration

After installation, you need to load and configure WindowBorder.spoon in your Hammerspoon configuration file, typically `~/.hammerspoon/init.lua`.

1.  **Edit `~/.hammerspoon/init.lua`:** Open this file in your favorite text editor.

2.  **Add Configuration:** Copy and paste the following lines into your `init.lua` file. You can adjust the `borderColor`, `borderWidth`, and `cornerRadius` to match your preferences.

    ```lua
    -- Load the WindowBorder Spoon
    hs.loadSpoon("WindowBorder")

    -- Configure the border appearance (optional, defaults are applied if not set)
    spoon.WindowBorder.borderColor = "#FF8800" -- Example: Vibrant Orange
    spoon.WindowBorder.borderWidth = 6         -- Example: 6 pixels thick
    spoon.WindowBorder.cornerRadius = 10       -- Example: Rounded corners

    -- Start the WindowBorder functionality
    spoon.WindowBorder:start()
    ```

    *   **`spoon.WindowBorder.borderColor`**: Sets the color of the border. Use a hex color code.
    *   **`spoon.WindowBorder.borderWidth`**: Sets the thickness of the border in pixels.
    *   **`spoon.WindowBorder.cornerRadius`**: Sets the radius for rounded corners in pixels.

3.  **Reload Hammerspoon:** After saving `init.lua`, reload your Hammerspoon configuration (usually by clicking the Hammerspoon icon in your menubar and selecting "Reload Config" or by pressing `Cmd + Opt + Ctrl + R`).

### üõë Stopping the Border

To temporarily disable the window border without removing the configuration, you can call:

```lua
spon.WindowBorder:stop()
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Restarting the Border

If you've stopped the border and wish to restart it, simply call:

```lua
spon.WindowBorder:start()
```
